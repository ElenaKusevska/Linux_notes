Make a branch in a fork up to date with the master of the forked original, when it is behind and ahead in commits, and you want to discard the ahead commits

# clone/create the branch
git clone 
git checkout -b branch_name
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name

OR

git clone -b branch_name

# reset back to a time when it was not ahead of the forked original in commits
git reset --hard hexhex0
git push -f

# include the commits from the forked repo master that it is behind in
git remote -v
origin	https://home.git (fetch)
origin	https://home.git (push)

git remote add upstream https://github.com/forked.git
git remote -v

origin	    https://home.git (fetch)
origin	    https://home.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/forked.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/forked.git (push)

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master # Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch.
git push
